# MIPS-Emulator-
 a MIPS emulator which will model the execution of instructions on a MIPS CPU.  This program will work like SPIM in that it will emulate the state of the registers and memory.
The program will emulate the MIPS registers, data memory (use an int array size 8192), and program counter.
